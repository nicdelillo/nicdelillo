## Hi there 👋

# 👋 Ciao! I'm Nic
- 🔭 I am currently working as a data engineer
- 🚀 I have been a gravitational wave astronomer serving for LIGO Collaboration working neutron stars and black holes
- 🌱 Learning learning Spark, Machine Learning and AI 
- 🛠️ Building [quantoprendo.io](https://quantoprendo.io), a salary tax calculator and personal finance community for italian workers
- 🧠 I am a forever curious, mountain lover, I am happy to chat about natural sciences, psychology, nutrion, biomechanic and sport science, personal finance

## 🧠 My experties cover
Data Analysis, Bayesian Probability and inferences, Numerical Simulations, Cloud Computing, Software and Data Engineering, Gravitational Waves and Multi-messenger Astronomy.

## 🧰 My Tech Stack
**Languages**: Python, SQL, a tiny bit of C and C++ \
**Tools**: Dagster, dbt, DLT, Sling, Postgres, MySQL, FastAPI, pandas, polars, AWS, Docker

## 🪐 My Astro Stack
**LIGO Tools**: lalsuite, bilby, pyGRB,PyCBC, PESummary,bayeswave, gwpy \
**Misc**: astropy, astroquery, LaTex, Matlab, Mathematica

## ⚡ Fun fact:
I was the first lucky person analyising [GW200105](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15163) the first ever detected gravitational wave from  neutron star-black hole system. I had the honour to lead the science case for this amazing astronomical event, giving my small contribution to enable one of the most exciting discovery of hour century.

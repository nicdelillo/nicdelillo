# 👋 Ciao! I'm Nic
- 🔭 I am currently working as a data engineer
- 🚀 I have been a gravitational wave astronomer serving for LIGO and working neutron star, black holes and parameter estimation 
- 🌱 Learning learning Spark, Machine Learning and AI 
- 🛠️ Building [quantoprendo.io](https://quantoprendo.io), a salary tax calculator and personal finance community for italian workers
- 🧠 I am a forever curious, mountain lover, I am happy to chat about natural sciences, psychology, nutrion, biomechanic and sport science, personal finance
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was the first lucky person analyising [GW200105](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15163) the first ever detected gravitational wave from  neutron star-black hole system and had the honour to lead the science case for this astronomical event, giving my  contribution to enable one of the most exciting discovery of hour century.

## 👋 Ciao! I'm Nic

🚀 I’m currently working as Data Engineer remotely from Italy.  
🌀 Previously, I was a gravitational-wave astronomer for the [LIGO](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/ligo-scientific-collaboration) and [Virgo](https://www.virgo-gw.eu/about/scientific-collaboration) Collaboration, exploring neutron stars and black holes.  
🛠️ I'm building [quantoprendo.io](https://quantoprendo.io), a salary tax calculator and personal finance community for Italian workers.  
🌱 Currently learning: Apache Spark, Machine Learning & AI.  
🧠 Forever curious: passionate about natural sciences, psychology, nutrition, biomechanics, sport science and personal finance.

### ⚡ Fun Fact

I was the first lucky person to analyze [GW200105](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15163) — the **first-ever gravitational wave from a neutron star–black hole system**.  
I had the honor to lead the science case, contributing to one of the most exciting discoveries of our century.
